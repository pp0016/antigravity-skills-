# Workflow Examples

These examples show how an agent should combine the packaged tools. Adapt paths
inside a `tmp/video_jobs/<job_id>/` folder for real jobs.

## 1. Avatar over product screen recording

Use when the user wants a founder/tutorial presenter over a SaaS walkthrough.

Steps:

1. Write a short narration script.
2. Generate a HeyGen avatar clip on green screen.
3. Record the product workflow with event logging.
4. Compose avatar over the screen recording.
5. Add captions, music, and final QC.

Commands:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/heygen_client.py
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/screen_recorder.py
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/demo_video_composer.py
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/ffmpeg_qc.py demo_videos/final_demo.mp4
```

Use `FFMPEG_PLAYBOOK.md` for chroma-key overlay if the avatar should appear
inside the demo composition rather than before/after it.

## 2. Faceless b-roll ad

Use when the user wants TikTok/Reels/Shorts style ads with generated clips,
voiceover, captions, and music.

Steps:

1. Create a 20-40 second hook-driven script.
2. Split script into 4-6 visual beats.
3. Generate one Seedance clip per beat.
4. Generate voiceover and music.
5. Concatenate clips, captions, and audio.
6. Export `9:16`, optionally `1:1` and `16:9`.

Seedance example:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/fal_seedance_video.py generate \
  --mode text \
  --prompt "handheld UGC shot of a startup founder opening a laptop, fast-paced, natural light, realistic" \
  --duration 7 \
  --resolution 720p \
  --aspect-ratio 9:16
```

## 3. Captioned talking head with b-roll

Use when the user already has a main talking-head MP4 and wants word captions
plus b-roll picture-in-picture windows.

Steps:

1. Put main video in `remotion-template/public/source/main.mp4`.
2. Put b-roll clips in `remotion-template/public/broll/`.
3. Build `public/render-props.json` from word timestamps and b-roll manifest.
4. Preview in Remotion Studio.
5. Render final MP4.

Commands:

```bash
cd .agents/skills/super-video-maker/remotion-template
npm install
npx remotion studio
npx remotion render src/index.ts CaptionedTalkingHead out/captioned.mp4 --props=public/render-props.json
```

## 4. HyperFrames HTML-native video

Use when the agent can define the whole video as HTML, especially for kinetic
text, simple product visuals, data visuals, and ad variants.

Steps:

1. Edit `hyperframes-template/compositions/demo.html`.
2. Preview in browser.
3. Render deterministic MP4.
4. Finish audio/captions with FFmpeg if needed.

Commands:

```bash
cd .agents/skills/super-video-maker/hyperframes-template
npm install
npx hyperframes preview compositions/demo.html
npx hyperframes render compositions/demo.html --output out/demo.mp4
```

## 5. Long video to vertical shorts

Use when the user has a podcast, tutorial, webinar, sales call, or YouTube
video and wants short social clips.

Steps:

1. Transcribe the full video once.
2. Pick segments and titles.
3. Render each vertical short with top title and karaoke captions.
4. QC each output.

Command:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/video_captioner.py
```

The packaged script keeps simple hardcoded parameters near the bottom so the
user can edit the file and press run.

## 6. Generated thumbnail and video stills

Use OpenAI image generation/editing when the video needs a thumbnail, title
card, background plate, or storyboard image.

Suggested flow:

1. Generate three thumbnail concepts.
2. Pick the best one.
3. Edit for brand colors and exact title text.
4. Save as `thumbnail.png`.
5. Optionally extract a still from the final video and edit it.

The provider adapter should save images into the job folder and emit `RESULT:`
with `local_path`, `prompt`, `size`, and `provider`.

## 7. Final delivery package

For a complete job, return:

- `master_16x9.mp4` when relevant,
- `vertical_9x16.mp4` when relevant,
- `square_1x1.mp4` when relevant,
- caption file (`.srt` or `.ass`) if requested,
- thumbnail image,
- `job_state.json`,
- a short production summary.

Do not include temporary frames or provider caches in the final delivery list.

## 9. Story-driven master with Whisper-locked beats and a unified b-roll set

This is the highest-coherence workflow used for the SEO news master video.
Reference implementation lives in `tmp/video_jobs/seo_news_tutorial/` (helper
scripts + `storyboard.json` + `final/seo_news_tutorial_master_v4_storytelling_seedance.mp4`).

Pipeline:

1. Write a story-first script: hook -> casual avatar disclosure (in the avatar's own voice) -> news beat -> concrete example -> source proof -> action step. Do NOT plan a static disclaimer slide before the hook.
2. Render the HeyGen avatar with the matching avatar+voice IDs.
3. Extract the avatar audio with FFmpeg and Whisper-transcribe with word + segment timestamps.
4. Inspect Whisper segments and trim the avatar to the first unique pass if HeyGen duplicated the script.
5. Build a `storyboard.json` whose beats start and end on Whisper sentence boundaries. Map each beat to a layout (avatar fullscreen / b-roll PiP / browser PiP), a b-roll asset, a chapter title, and a lower-third source attribution.
6. Build a source deck and route every visual by editorial job (proof / mechanism / consequence / action / transition). Real screenshots, UI micro-stories, typographic cards, and real screen recordings come before generated b-roll. If generation is unavoidable, use `gpt-image-2` at `quality=high`, native 16:9 (`2048x1152`), documentary-realism prompts, and short 2-4s cuts.
7. For any beat that is longer than the natural b-roll clip, never loop. Choose one of: a complementary b-roll for the second half, `tpad=stop_mode=clone:stop_duration=N` to hold the final frame for ≤2 seconds, or a Ken Burns still as the continuation.
8. Record the agent-operated browser segments for the proof beats (`tools/agent_browser_recorder.py`) and slice them per beat.
9. Render an outro recap card (1920x1080) with the action steps and the digital-avatar disclosure. Skip the static title card.
10. Build a Hormozi-style ASS karaoke caption file from the Whisper words. Master offset is 0 (master timeline matches avatar timeline since there is no title pre-roll). Default captions are bottom-centered, so the avatar PiP belongs in the top-right.
11. Compose with FFmpeg in clean steps:
    - encode each timeline segment to 1920x1080 30fps yuv420p silent MP4,
    - concat into a single background track,
    - overlay the avatar PiP top-right as a borderless rounded card with soft drop shadow,
    - if the avatar's own audio does not include the disclosure, overlay a small top-left PNG badge during the first ~4.5 seconds,
    - burn the karaoke captions,
    - mux master audio (avatar audio + outro silence) with `loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11`.
12. Sanity-check the timeline by sampling JPEG frames at every beat and reading them visually to verify the visual matches the audio at that moment.

The reference helper scripts in `tmp/video_jobs/seo_news_tutorial/` are reusable templates:

- `build_master_captions_v2.py` — Whisper words to karaoke ASS, master_offset=0.
- `build_cards.py` — branded outro card with disclosure baked in.
- `render_broll.py` — sequential Seedance b-roll generation.
- `render_kenburns_broll.py` — OpenAI `gpt-image-2` high-quality 16:9 still + scale-to-fill Ken Burns fallback for new b-roll.
- `compose_master_v4.py` — full FFmpeg compose pipeline with sentence-aligned cuts, faster 2-4s visual cadence, borderless PiP, top-left disclosure badge, and karaoke captions.

## 8. Story-driven SEO/news tutorial

Use when the user wants a news explainer that feels like a mini documentary,
not a slideshow.

Steps:

1. Write a story-first script:
   - hook,
   - transparent avatar disclosure,
   - news beat,
   - concrete example,
   - browser source proof,
   - action step.
2. Generate the HeyGen presenter with the matching avatar and matching voice.
3. Record coherent browser proof with `agent_browser_recorder.py`.
4. Generate 2-4 Seedance b-roll clips for the story/example beats.
5. If Seedance credits are unavailable, use `local_explainer_broll.py` as a temporary animated fallback.
6. Interweave browser proof and b-roll with FFmpeg or Remotion.
7. Add large punchy captions for key claims.

Commands:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/agent_browser_recorder.py
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/fal_seedance_video.py generate --mode text --prompt "original educational explainer metaphor..." --duration 7 --resolution 720p --aspect-ratio 16:9
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/local_explainer_broll.py
```

Example transparency line after the hook:

```text
Quick note: this is Borja's digital avatar walking you through the update.
```

## 10. Avatar Explainer (`avatar-explainer`) → 90-second master with editorial source deck + spoken CTA tail (CURRENT BEST PRACTICE)

Use this when the user wants a short trending-news master video with a natural
ending, clean professional overlays, and high-taste visual logic. This is the
v4 Googlebook pattern plus the source-deck/editorial-grammar rules
(reference job: `tmp/video_jobs/x_trending_20260512_1751/`,
`final/googlebook_trending_v4.mp4`). Supersedes workflow #8 and #9 for any
new short-form news/trending master.

Pipeline:

1. **Pick the trend.** If X.com is gated, triangulate via Trends24 + WebSearch
   and confirm with at least two source pages (e.g. official blog post +
   Techmeme aggregation). Save canonical URLs in `job_state.json`.
2. **Build the source deck before writing the storyboard.** Each source asset
   needs a unique editorial job:
   - official announcement hero = proof / establishing receipt,
   - exact paragraph crop = proof of the technical claim,
   - feature section crop = mechanism,
   - byline/date crop = credibility receipt,
   - aggregator or outlet list = consequence / momentum,
   - UI/action surface = action step.
   Never plan "same website again, slightly different zoom" unless the second
   shot proves a different phrase or mechanism.
3. **Write the script with the mandatory CTA tail.** Hook → casual avatar
   disclosure → news beat → concrete story/example → source proof → 3-move
   action close → 6-8s spoken CTA tail ("If this kind of teardown is useful,
   hit follow over at <domain> for more <topic>. See you in the next one.").
   Keep the body around 75-85s and the master around 90-100s with the CTA.
4. **Render HeyGen** with the matching avatar+voice IDs (e.g. avatar
   `731c0983f6664e86857ea60cdb87ba42` paired with voice
   `028e8a5d94bd4fceaf2ffe5e51cc27cb`).
5. **Extract audio + Whisper-transcribe** with word + segment timestamps. Note
   where the action close ends and where the CTA tail starts — the gap is
   where the outro card replaces the b-roll.
6. **Build a `storyboard.json`** with beats locked to Whisper sentence
   boundaries. For every shot include: narration, visual job (proof /
   mechanism / consequence / action / transition), surface, before state,
   cursor/action/motion, after state, source-deck asset, and reject list.
   Plan layout zones up front: hook fullscreen, body beats with PiP top-right
   + b-roll/browser-proof center, outro card during CTA tail.
7. **Pick visuals by beat purpose, not by prompt creativity.** For each
   non-hook beat, route through the table in `REFERENCE.md` ("B-roll design
   system") and the "Editorial taste system". Real visuals and UI micro-stories
   beat generated visuals every single time:
   - News beat → real screenshot of the official announcement → Ken Burns.
   - Source proof → agent-operated browser recording or real screenshot.
   - Story/example → working surface where the change happens (doc, dashboard,
     calendar, SERP, Slack thread, CMS), not a generic person.
   - Concept/metaphor → typographic pull-quote card, UI state change, or real
     object with a specific editorial purpose.
   - Aggregate → Techmeme/Trends/HN screenshot → Ken Burns.
   - Action step → real UI screenshot with a drawn arrow overlay.
   Generated b-roll is the **last** option in every category. When you must
   generate, use `gpt-image-2`, `quality=high`, native 16:9, documentary-realism
   prompts, and 2-4s cuts.
8. **Design story/example beats as micro-stories.** Example: for "Picture this,
   you're a founder who lives in Google Docs," do not show a founder at a
   laptop. Show a Google Docs-style launch plan with comments, TODOs, dates,
   thumbnails, a pasted chart, and cursor-driven action cards:
   `date detected -> schedule launch review`, `two images selected -> create
   launch graphic`, `prompt -> dashboard widget appears`.
9. **Generate proof Ken Burns clips from real screenshots** at exact beat
   durations, but split any long screenshot beat into different roles/crops:
   establishing receipt, exact phrase crop, feature crop, and headline cluster.
10. **Record agent-operated browser proof when it adds evidence.** The recording
    should look like investigation: headline highlight, find-on-page, jump to
    feature, exact paragraph callout, tab switch to aggregator, outlet cluster
    zoom. Do not include slow filler scrolling.
11. **Run b-roll layout QC before composition.** After all b-roll/UI/source
    clips render, run `tools/broll_layout_qc.py` on every candidate b-roll
    asset and review the generated contact sheet before the master compose:
    ```bash
    python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/broll_layout_qc.py \
      tmp/video_jobs/<job_id>/assets/v5_clips/*.mp4 \
      --job-dir tmp/video_jobs/<job_id>
    ```
    Mark every asset `pass`, `crop-edit`, `layout-edit`, `re-render`, or
    `replace`. Fix spacing problems before final composition: text under PiP,
    key content in the caption band, cramped cards, clipped UI, awkward edge
    tangents, or unclear visual job. Cheap fix order: crop/reframe -> layout
    edit -> prompt/re-render -> replace.
12. **Render the disclosure badge once** with Pillow:
   `build_disclosure_badge.py` → `assets/disclosure_badge.png` (transparent
   rounded pill, dark navy fill, orange outline, white text). Reuse this as
   the template for any branded chip in future jobs.
13. **Render the outro recap card** (1920x1080) with the action steps and a
   permanent disclosure footer in the bottom-center.
14. **Build centered karaoke captions** from the Whisper words —
    `Alignment=2, MarginL=MarginR=80, MarginV=90, FontSize=64`. Active word
    yellow, white drop shadow, black 5px outline.
15. **Compose with FFmpeg** in one pass:
    - encode each timeline segment to 1920x1080 30fps yuv420p silent MP4,
    - concat into a single background track with the outro card extended to
      match the spoken CTA tail (`outro_duration = avatar_total - body_end`),
    - overlay avatar PiP at `x=W-pip_w-50:y=50` (top-right) **borderless,
      with rounded corners via `alphamerge` against `pip_mask.png` and a
      soft drop shadow via `pip_shadow.png` offset `+4 / +16`** (see
      "Avatar PiP styling" in `REFERENCE.md`); `enable='between(t,t0,t1)'`
      for each non-fullscreen beat, hidden during the outro CTA tail,
    - overlay disclosure badge top-left with
      `enable='between(t,0.5,4.5)'`,
    - burn ASS captions (centered),
    - mux master audio with `loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11`.
16. **Visual QC.** Sample JPEG frames at every beat (hook, b-roll
    transitions, proof, action close, mid-CTA, end-CTA) and read them with
    vision to confirm: no overlapping overlays, captions centered,
    PiP top-right, badge only during hook, outro card visible during CTA,
    no repeated source wallpaper, every visual has one of the five jobs.

Reference helpers in `tmp/video_jobs/x_trending_20260512_1751/`:

- `avatar_script_v2.txt` — script with mandatory CTA tail.
- `build_disclosure_badge.py` — transparent rounded-pill PNG.
- `whisper_transcribe_v2.py` — Whisper transcription with words+segments.
- `build_master_captions_v2.py` — centered karaoke ASS template.
- `build_outro_card.py` — branded recap card with disclosure footer.
- `render_broll.py` — Seedance with OpenAI Ken Burns fallback in one
  unified prompt vocabulary.
- `build_proof_kenburns.py` — Ken Burns from real screenshots.
- `compose_master_v2.py` — full FFmpeg compose with non-colliding zones,
  outro card extended under the CTA tail, and centered captions.
- `render_v4_photos.py` — `gpt-image-2`, `quality=high`, native 16:9 image generation.
- `build_v4_kenburns.py` — faster scale-to-fill Ken Burns cuts, no padding bars.
- `compose_master_v4.py` — 18-cut reference master with borderless PiP and faster pacing.
- `tools/broll_layout_qc.py` — pre-compose b-roll spacing/layout contact sheet with PiP/caption/safe-zone guides.

Twelve lessons that this workflow is built around (learned the hard way on
v1 through v4 plus the taste review of the Googlebook job):

- **Never overlap captions and lower-third.** Move the disclosure to a
  top-left PNG badge that fades before the PiP appears.
- **Captions must be centered.** Left-aligned looks amateur and forces
  asymmetric layouts.
- **Never end on silence.** The outro card needs spoken audio under it or
  the video feels broken.
- **PiP must be borderless with rounded corners and a soft drop shadow.** A
  hard colored frame reads as cheap TV-news lower-third. The borderless
  card style matches modern UI conventions and pairs cleanly with centered
  captions.
- **Real visuals beat generated visuals.** AI-slop b-roll (dark cosmic
  backgrounds, glowing icons, floating subjects, fake premium gradients)
  destroys credibility. Default to real screenshots, real stock footage,
  and typographic cards. Generated b-roll is a last resort with strict
  documentary-realism prompts.
- **Use `gpt-image-2` at `quality=high`, not `gpt-image-1`.** State-of-the-art quality is non-negotiable for documentary photos — depth of field, skin texture, and realistic lighting are dramatically better at high quality.
- **Generate at native 16:9 (`2048x1152`).** Anything non-16:9 forces letterbox padding when composited; padding on documentary photos screams "generated". Ken Burns scales-to-fill + centre-crops, never pads.
- **Cut every 2-4 s on AI stills, every 3-6 s on real screenshots.** Holding any single AI-generated still for more than ~3.5 s reads as generated. Long beats split into 2-3 cuts of different photos, different crops of the same screenshot, or alternating photo/screenshot/card textures. Reference master `googlebook_trending_v4.mp4` ships 18 visual cuts in 96.87 s.
- **Every visual needs one editorial job.** Proof, mechanism, consequence, action, or transition. If it is none of those, it is filler.
- **Screenshots are receipts, not wallpaper.** Repeating the same website hero with slightly different zooms is weak. Each repeat must prove a new phrase, source detail, feature, or coverage point.
- **Screen recordings must investigate.** Cursor jumps, find-on-page, callouts, tab switches, and exact source receipts are good. Slow scrolling is filler.
- **Story beats need working surfaces.** "Founder lives in Google Docs" should show a messy Google Docs-style launch plan turning into actions, not a generic founder photo.
- **B-roll needs its own layout QC/edit pass.** Generated clips and UI cards often have spacing mistakes. Use the guided contact sheet to catch PiP collisions, caption-band collisions, cramped typography, clipped UI, and unclear visual jobs before composing.

## 11. UGC AI Ad (`ugc-ai-ad`) -> fictional creator + Seedance consistency

Use this when the user wants paid-social UGC ads that look like a real creator
recorded them on a phone, while keeping the character and voice consistent
across hooks and scenes.

Pipeline:

1. **Build the ad brief.** Capture product, offer, ICP, pain point, landing
   page, desired conversion event, allowed proof, banned claims, platform,
   aspect ratio, duration, and testing budget.
2. **Write the variant matrix first.** Produce 5-8 hooks across confession,
   contrarian, problem-callout, receipt/proof, demo-first, speedrun,
   before/after, and curiosity-gap families. Pick 2-3 hooks for the first
   render batch.
3. **Create the fictional creator.** Use a user-provided or licensed real
   person image only as a quality reference. Edit it into a distinct fictional
   adult creator with `gpt-image-2`, `quality=high`, `input_fidelity=high`.
   Save approved references in `assets/character/`.
4. **Save `character_card.json`.** Include creator name, fictional bio,
   wardrobe, camera energy, `visual_seed`, `voice_id`/`voice_seed`, approved
   reference image paths, allowed claims, banned claims, and negative prompts.
5. **Generate Seedance clips.** Use the same `--seed` and the same approved
   `--reference-image` values for every beat. Vary only the action and camera
   direction: hook talking-to-camera, product demo, UI proof insert, objection
   line, CTA close.
6. **Generate or lock voice separately.** Prefer a fixed ElevenLabs voice ID
   for ad batches. Use Seedance native audio only when the raw phone-recorded
   feel is more important than repeatable voice control.
7. **Assemble the ad.** First frame text must match the hook. Use jump cuts,
   large captions, product inserts, quick proof overlays, and a direct CTA.
8. **QC before export.** Reject face drift, voice drift, uncanny hands/teeth,
   too-polished skin, fake testimonial wording, unverifiable claims, or any
   output too close to the source person's identity.
9. **Export variants.** Render `9:16` first, then optional `1:1` or `4:5`.
   Deliver MP4s, captions, `variant_matrix.json`, `character_card.json`,
   prompts, seeds, and QC notes.

## 12. Motion Collage Explainer (`motion-collage-explainer`) -> faceless "In a Nutshell" concept short

Full method and prompt formulas: `MOTION_COLLAGE_STYLE.md`. One concept, 20 to 45s,
9:16. Bold screen-print cutout collage stills, Seedance living-collage motion, calm
documentary voiceover. No presenter, no screen recording.

```bash
# 1) Script the ONE idea in the "In a Nutshell" docu voice, split into 3-6 beats.
#    Open on a question/scenario -> name the concept -> one analogy -> takeaway -> soft CTA.

# 2) Build each collage poster still (gpt-image-2). 9:16 uses 1024x1536.
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/image_provider.py generate \
  --prompt "Flat screen-print collage poster, single saturated cobalt-blue background, subtle newsprint grain. Centerpiece: a black-and-white halftone cutout of a tiny suited man flailing and drowning inside a giant wine glass, treated as a paper sticker with a thin white die-cut outline, torn edges, soft drop shadow. Visible halftone dots, vintage editorial photo feel. Accent cutouts: a cream circle top-left, a solid navy triangle bottom-right, a few white water droplets. Torn-paper label near the bottom reading 'DROWNING IN A GLASS OF WATER' in bold condensed uppercase newspaper type. Matte risograph aesthetic, limited palette. Leave headroom at top and a clear band at bottom for the label. Avoid gradients, glow, neon, 3D render, photorealism, extra text." \
  --size 1024x1536 --quality high --output-format png

# 3) Animate the approved still into a living collage (image-to-video).
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/fal_seedance_video.py generate \
  --mode image \
  --reference-image output_images/collage_beat1.png \
  --prompt "Subtle living-collage motion. The paper cutout gently bobs with soft parallax against the flat background. Accent shapes drift and rotate slightly. Water ripples inside the glass and one droplet falls. Faint halftone shimmer, gentle slow push-in. Everything stays a flat printed paper collage, texture preserved. No new objects, no camera whip, no realistic 3D, no scene change, no morphing faces, no added text." \
  --duration 5 --resolution 1080p --aspect-ratio 9:16

# 4) ElevenLabs docu VO -> Whisper word timing -> beat-lock cuts to sentence breaks.
# 5) Concat beats, centered karaoke captions clear of the torn-paper label band, loudnorm.
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/video_captioner.py
python3 .agents/skills/super-video-maker/tools/ffmpeg_qc.py
```

QC: every frame still reads as a flat printed collage (Seedance did not realify it),
consistent background/outline/label across beats, no glow/neon/3D/gradient, subtle
loop-safe motion, captions synced and clear of the label. For the keyword-led title,
description, tags, and publish-to-YouTube wrapper, drive this recipe from the Distribb
skill's `/youtube-motion-video` playbook.
