# Changelog

## v3.21.0 — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **higgsfield-seedance 1.10.0 — two new Prompt-Craft Laws** (2026-07-14):
  - *Ambiguous verbs — the homograph trap* (Peter's field find, covered by no
    known prompt guide): if a verb/noun has a plausible second reading
    ("tearing" = rip vs cry), the model may take it — replace with the phrasing
    only one thing can look like; ships with a seed homograph list.
  - *Community v3 cherry-picks* (Joey drop, audited vs this skill): camera on
    the shadow side + stated operator axis, detail-on-wide "snake cam",
    intimate wide, prompt-reset heuristic, canonical-over-plate,
    contrast-curve-stated-three-ways. Their camera-block-at-bottom claim is
    flagged, not adopted (contradicts CAMERA-3rd; test day pending).


## v3.20.1 — 2026-07-06

### Changed
- **Sora 2 UI presence confirmed** (user screenshot of the live model picker, 2026-07-06): the v3.20.0 "verify in the live UI" caveat is upgraded to fact. It is a **4-variant family** — Sora 2 (720p) / Sora 2 Pro (1080p) / Sora 2 Max / Sora 2 Pro Max (both 1080p, "BY HIGGSFIELD" enhanced tiers), all 4–12s, multi-shot with sound generation — present in the UI but still absent from the API/MCP catalog (UI generations only). model-guide.md row now carries the variant lineup and real duration/resolution; root SKILL.md and `higgsfield-assist` (3.1.1) caveats updated to the confirmed wording.


## v3.20.0 — 2026-07-06

**Audio specs pipeline + catalog-reality refresh.** The specs layer now covers all three output types end-to-end, the dispatcher gained a Load Map, and the two stalest model surfaces (higgsfield-assist, the Sora 2 / "Seedance Pro" mentions) were reconciled with the live catalog.

### Added
- **Audio specs pipeline**: `scripts/sync_specs.py --type audio` generates `specs/audio-model-specs.{yaml,json}` + `specs/AUDIO-MODEL-SPECS.md` from the dated audio snapshot (5 models incl. `seed_audio`); `scripts/refresh_specs.py` default is now `all` (video+image+audio — `both` kept as the pre-audio alias), audio captured into `specs/cli_baseline.json`, tripwire green across all three types. Typed-spec markdown footers now point at their own machine twins (was: everything pointed at the video files). `higgsfield-audio` 3.3.1 cites the generated audio specs.
- **Load Map** (root SKILL.md § Load Map — how much to read): a situation → cumulative-load table so multi-skill loads are deterministic instead of vibes — Fast Path loads two files, everything else adds only what its routing row names.

### Changed
- **Sora 2 is UI-only** — absent from the API catalog and a live `models_explore` search (verified 2026-07-05). Kept everywhere but annotated: root SKILL.md "What Is Higgsfield?", model-guide.md (video-table row, decision flowchart demoted to parenthetical, camera-control + motion-preset † footnotes, credit table), higgsfield-assist. Root Fast Path default swapped Sora 2 → Seedance 2.0 (action/scale/references).
- **"Seedance Pro" is a legacy UI label** — not in the catalog; annotated in model-guide + assist as superseded by Seedance 1.5 Pro (`seedance1_5`) and Seedance 2.0 Fast/Mini (annotate-don't-delete, per the GPT Image precedent).
- **`higgsfield-assist` 3.0.0 → 3.1.0** (first refresh since 2026-04-06): credit-cost tier roster rebuilt against the 2026-07-05 catalog; "Kling 3.0 for anything needing audio" corrected — audio is native across Seedance 2.0/Mini/1.5 Pro (`generate_audio`), Kling 3.0/2.6 (`sound`), Veo 3.1 Lite: pick by scene fit, then toggle; plans table now carries a dated verify-live caveat; audio-toggle credit-saving tip added. Kling 2.6 audio cell in model-guide fixed to match the live spec (`sound` param, default on).
- **CS3.5 shot-counter TODO closed** (`higgsfield-cinema`): API checked 2026-07-05 — `multi_prompt` exposes no maximum and no constraint rule, so the observed cap of 4 is UI behavior the API doesn't document; treat 4 as the working limit, verify live before promising more.
- CLAUDE.md: specs/ line + sync command now cover all three types.


## v3.19.1 — 2026-07-06

Housekeeping wave: activate the weekly spec-drift schedule, absorb the CLI 1.1.5 release, de-clutter the repo root, and archive the changelog backlog. No prompting-content changes.

### Changed
- **Spec-drift schedule is LIVE**: `HIGGSFIELD_CREDENTIALS` repo secret added; a manual `workflow_dispatch` run verified the full path end-to-end (install → version guard → tripwire → issue-on-drift). The run surfaced CLI **1.1.5**, which *restores* the per-param `enum` lists that 1.0.1 dropped (and keeps `job_type` + CEL rules) — the tripwire regains full enum visibility with no parser change. Local CLI upgraded, baseline re-captured with 1.1.5, `LAST_VERIFIED_CLI` bumped 1.0.1 → 1.1.5, drift issue #78 closed as a cross-version artifact.
- **Root scripts consolidated into `scripts/`**: all 9 Python tools (`validate.py`, `build_index.py`, `sync_specs.py`, `refresh_specs.py`, `higgsfield_memory.py`, `seedance_lint.py`, `generate_user_guide.py`, `validate_user_guide.py`, `sub_skill_descriptions.py`) moved via `git mv`; internal `__file__`-derived roots, test/eval importers, CI workflows, slash commands, CLAUDE.md, README, DISCIPLINE.md, and 14 skill files updated. Commands are now `python3 scripts/validate.py` etc. Root .md/.py clutter roughly halved.
- **CHANGELOG archived**: entries v3.0.0–v3.14.1 (69 releases, ~375 KB) rolled verbatim into `docs/archive/CHANGELOG-v3.0-v3.14.md`; root CHANGELOG keeps the current era (v3.15.0+) plus a pointer.


## v3.19.0 — 2026-07-05

**Seedance 4K Masterclass + Seed Audio 1.0** — content wave from six sources gathered 2026-07-05 (plan: `workspace/output/V3.19-PLAN.md`): Higgsfield's own downloadable `prompt-writter.skill`, the official Seedance-4K film tutorial (video + blog, 25 verbatim prompts archived in `workspace/input/`), spec-verified Seed Audio 1.0 research, a cross-surface video-extension workflow, selected field imports from the community seedance-2.0 repo (v6.6.0), and a character-audition system prompt. Every model claim checked against the fresh 2026-07-05 specs snapshots (shipped in v3.18.1). Provenance tiers used throughout: [OFFICIAL] / [DEMO] / [EMPIRICAL] / [FIELD].

### `higgsfield-seedance` 1.8.2 → 1.9.0
- **§ Official Prompt Architecture — the Block Scaffold** [OFFICIAL — Higgsfield prompt-writter.skill]: the 17-block scaffold (SCENE CONTEXT → POSITIVE LOCKS), distributed-style doctrine (no style prefix), FOV-in-degrees anchor table + CAMERA-3rd-position rule, measurable-language rules (positive-only, km/h, %/meters, human-height scale, left/right-from-camera, Kelvin WB, no director/equipment names), POSITIVE LOCKS, the cut-format ladder + 6-cut vocabulary, tag naming + minimal-reference-text, context isolation, and 4 special protocols (extreme-FOV 4-mechanism stack, whip-pan ≥0.8s, anti-impact locks, observation pattern). Reconciled as a "two regimes" doctrine with the existing six-slot short form; official no-director-names rule noted as overriding the empirical director-substitute trick in block prompts.
- **NEW reference `PRODUCTION-PATTERNS.md`** [DEMO — Seedance-4K film tutorial]: reference-role vocabulary ("100% matches the reference" / "STYLE REFERENCE ONLY, model extends the world" / "VARIETY reference" + the clone-army fix), coordinate blocking (x%/y%, % of frame width, locked screen direction), non-empty opening frame, per-segment LENS LOCK + timed SMASH/MATCH cuts, red-arrow prop annotation, video-reference 1:1 lock + SCREEN REALISM block + duration-match rule, prompted-imperfection realism, 60:30:10 grade, offscreen voice-only characters, specify-what-plays-on-screens, in-prompt scene transitions.
- **§ Extension Prompting — Video-Reference Continuation** [EMPIRICAL]: "The scene continues." / "Show me what happens before" openers, occluded-identity `@ImageN` binding, match-source-resolution-AND-duration, chain-degradation + B-roll chain-break, camera-angle-change endings; [FIELD] source-carries-state + references-outrank-text + chain cap ~2 (hard 3) with re-anchor-from-ORIGINAL-references.

### `higgsfield-audio` 3.2.2 → 3.3.0
- **§ Scene-Audio Generation — Seed Audio 1.0**: what it is (one-pass whole-scene audio, released 2026-06-23), decision table vs `text2speech_v2` vs Seedance `generate_audio`, verified surface [OFFICIAL — 2026-07-05 audio snapshot] (params, ≤3 audio refs ≤30s XOR 1 image ref, `@Audio1..3` tokens), script-format prompting clearly labeled [EMPIRICAL — community, NOT official] with a worked example.
- Standalone Audio catalog reconciled with the live 5-model catalog (incl. NEW `cozy_voice` engine; game-pipeline-only tools flagged), date-stamped 2026-07-05.
- [FIELD] per-language dialogue-sync budget table (EN ~16–20 reliable-sync words per ~15s, Mandarin strongest, RU weak) + voice-reference lip-sync path (rights-sensitive) under Lip-Sync Rules; Supercomputer voice-over pointer [DEMO].

### `higgsfield-pipeline` 3.3.0 → 3.4.0
- **§ Continuation & Extension Handoff**: extend-a-clip workflow, chain management (depth caps + scheduled re-anchoring), source-carries-state rule (stills can't carry motion/camera/audio phase), clean-join planning (angle-change endings, last-channel-on-TV transition trick, post-edit seam note).

### `higgsfield-soul` 3.6.1 → 3.7.0 + asset-prep surfaces
- Two-image character floor (face + full body) + grey-sheet rule [DEMO]; **§ Split-Panel Outfit-Change Sheet** (ghost-mannequin + identity panel); **§ Variety Sheets — Crowds Without Clones**.
- `templates/ad-asset-prep.md`: grey-background canonical home, **§ Location plates (3/4 angle, empty by default)**, **§ Which model makes the sheet** (GPT Image 2 4K → Nano Banana Pro on flatness → Soul Cinema for locations/characters); Elements registration.
- `skills/higgsfield-gpt-image-2/reference-sheet-workflow.md`: **§ Views the video will need** (front/side/back + BOTTOM/undercarriage for flip shots), **§ Red-arrow annotation**.

### `higgsfield-character-design` 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
- **§ Screen Test / Audition** [EMPIRICAL]: casting read → role options → playable audition lines → voice triggers (≤3 qualities) → final audition prompt (<3500 chars) with divergence rule and a worked mini-example; cross-linked to FACS (direct the takes), Soul (lock the winner), and ad-asset-prep's generate-many → test-in-motion → lock-the-winner loop.

### `higgsfield-models` 3.1.1 → 3.2.0 + guides
- New model rows [spec-verbatim]: **Gemini Omni Flash** (video), **Soul Cast**, **Soul Location**, **Nano Banana 2 Lite**, **OpenAI Hazel** (image) across model-guide.md, image-models.md, and higgsfield-models (dual-maintained tables kept in sync); recraft id rename + Seedream 4.5 quality tiers reconciled; GPT Image (original) noted as gone from the 2026-07-05 catalog; utility jobs scoped out with a one-liner.

### Root + examples + evals
- `prompt-examples.md`: **§ Seedance-4K Film Tutorial — Worked Examples** — five annotated verbatim excerpts [DEMO] (prompted imperfection, coordinate blocking + LENS LOCKs, 1:1 video reference + SCREEN REALISM, red-arrow lock, VARIETY-reference before/after).
- Root SKILL.md: four new routing rows (standalone audio / Seed Audio → audio; extend-continue a clip → seedance + pipeline; asset prep / reference sheets → ad-asset-prep + gpt-image-2 + soul; character audition → character-design). Root version → 3.19.0.
- Evals: +3 cases (Seed Audio scene script, standalone-vs-in-video audio choice, extension continuation) — 43 total.

## v3.18.1 — 2026-07-05

Repair wave: un-blind the spec-drift tripwire after the Higgsfield CLI 1.0.1 output-shape change, refresh the specs snapshots (Tier 2, 13 days early — the shape change forced it), and clear the stale-docs debt found by a full repo audit. No new prompting content (that ships in v3.19.0).

### Fixed
- **`refresh_specs.py` crashed on CLI 1.0.1** (`KeyError: 'job_set_type'` — upstream renamed the id key to `job_type` and dropped per-param `enum` lists). Now accepts both key generations via `_model_id()`, and any future output-shape change raises a typed `ShapeError` → **new exit code 4** ("fix the parser") kept distinct from exit 1 ("re-auth") — previously a crash masqueraded as auth expiry in `spec-drift.yml`. The workflow gained a dedicated exit-4 step and a `LAST_VERIFIED_CLI` version guard (warns, never fails, on unverified upstream releases). Fixture-based regression tests added from recorded CLI 1.0.1 JSON (`tests/fixtures/cli_1_0_1_*.json`); 25 tests in `test_refresh.py`.
- **New CEL-rules comparison channel**: CLI 1.0.1 ships machine-readable constraint rules (e.g. Seedance's 9-image/3-video/3-audio/12-total reference caps, `mode='fast'` forbids 1080p/4k) — exactly the cross-constraint prose the tripwire was historically blind to. `cli_view()` now captures them; added rules = DRIFT, removed = notice; the channel only compares when both sides carry it (pre-1.0.1 baselines stay silent).
- **`sync_specs.py` lost the duration envelope**: 2026-07 snapshots moved `duration_range` into a `duration` *parameter* (min/max), which silently dropped `spec["duration"]` and broke `seedance_lint`'s `duration-out-of-range` rule — caught by the `trap-seedance-overlong-duration` eval (the v3.11.2 stale-eval trap working as designed). The envelope is now derived from the duration parameter; param `min`/`max` are preserved in generated specs.
- **`model-guide.md` Seedance 2.0 Mini row**: "UI label; not a distinct API id" is no longer true — `seedance_2_0_mini` is a distinct catalog id (4–15s, 480p/720p, full image/video/audio reference surface, native audio).
- **Broken link** `templates/ad-asset-prep.md` → `../docs/production-benchmarks.md` (file lives at repo root). `validate.py` now sweeps `templates/**/*.md` path-style refs (new `[ TEMPLATE PATHS ]` section) so this class can't recur.
- **Stale docs**: `photodump-presets.md` image-snapshot TODO (the snapshot has existed since 2026-06-22); CLAUDE.md counts (30 sub-skills, full templates/ inventory), specs/ description, missing release-gate commands (`--strict` + pytest + evals), release-ceremony pointer (tag the merge commit; PDF is an untracked artifact), and stale `/project:*` slash names (now `/validate`, `/release`). `release.md` step 1 now runs all three gates, not just strict validate. Dropped `Edit(mnt/**)` from `.claude/settings.json` — it invited exactly the mistake the mnt rule forbids.

### Changed
- **Specs snapshots refreshed** (video + image, 2026-06-22 → **2026-07-05**) and a **first audio snapshot captured** (`models_explore_snapshot_audio_2026-07-05.json`: `seed_audio` = **Seed Audio 1.0**, `sonilo_music`, `mirelo_text_to_audio`, `inworld_text_to_speech`, `text2speech_v2` with a new `cozy_voice` engine) — machine-readable ground truth for the v3.19.0 Seed Audio content; the audio sync pipeline is a follow-up.
- Snapshot deltas absorbed: video +`seedance_2_0_mini`/`gemini_omni`/`explainer_video` + utility jobs; image +`nano_banana_2_lite`/`soul_cast`/`openai_hazel`/`recraft_v4_1` (renamed from `recraft-v4-1`) + utility jobs; `seedance_2_0` media roles renamed to `image_references`/`video_references`/`audio_references` (+ kept `start_image`/`end_image`); id renames recorded as spec **aliases** via `HISTORICAL_IDS` (`seedance_1_5`→`seedance1_5`, `recraft-v4-1`→`recraft_v4_1`, dropped `video_standard` dup) so ledger rows and user inputs written under old ids keep resolving.
- CLI baseline re-accepted at 2026-07-05 (tripwire green end-to-end: 0 fresh / 3 change / 1 pull-failed / 4 shape-changed all exercised).
- Root SKILL.md: Shared Resources table now lists all 8 `templates/seedance/` files and surfaces `templates/ad-asset-prep.md` + `templates/character-design/`; added a consistency tie-break row (`higgsfield-soul` = lock identity in-platform vs `higgsfield-character-design` = develop the character first).

### Deferred to v3.19.0
- Guide rows/content for the new catalog models (gemini_omni, nano_banana_2_lite, openai_hazel, soul_cast, autosprite, ms_image), Seed Audio 1.0 prompting guidance, and the Seedance 4K masterclass material — content wave, planned at `workspace/output/V3.19-PLAN.md`.

## v3.18.0 — 2026-06-30

Video-to-video **footage transformation** for Seedance 2.0 — take a clip the user already shot, **preserve** the real subject + camera move, and **change one thing** (add a VFX element, swap the world, drop in a photoreal creature, relight to match, sync a timed zoom to a line). New **30th sub-skill** `higgsfield-seedance-vfx`. Sourced from a hand-authored practitioner skill + the Higgsfield "Seedance 2.0 in 4K" VFX tutorial (`higgsfield.ai/blog/vfx_4k`, `youtube.com/watch?v=Yte-UGhYkPQ`), which demonstrates this exact skill; model-checked against the live `seedance_2_0` spec — `media_roles` include `video` (v2v input is real), `4k` is a legal resolution, plus `audio`/`start_image`/`end_image`, duration 4–15s. One goal-driven release.

### New sub-skill — `higgsfield-seedance-vfx` (1.0.0)
A video-to-video layer on top of `higgsfield-seedance` (reuses its grammar + preflight linter; only the starting point changes — a real source clip whose subject and camera move must survive). Distinct from the parent's in-clip **Transformation prompt mode** (a morph generated from scratch). Sections:
- **Preserve, then change one thing** — lock identity/face/wardrobe/performance/framing/lens/camera, change only the named element, repeat the fragile guardrail at the end.
- **Run it in 4K** — Seedance 2.0 `mode=std` 4K (faces/lip-sync hold at 4K, warp at 1080p); harmonized with the repo's existing caps (fast → 720p; Cinema Studio → 1080p). The `4k` enum is model-verified; "detail holds at 4K" is flagged as a practitioner claim.
- **Prompt anatomy** — `@source` declaration, optional `@creature`/texture reference, specs line (NON-IP guardrail, match-source-runtime, `SFX` vs `SFX and source dialogue only`), continuous-shot action, behavioral SFX.
- **Three levels** — L1 swap the world · L2 change an element in-frame · L3 full handheld cinematic (difficulty scales with camera motion).
- **Two modes** (add an element · replace the environment) + the **lighting-integration recipe** (color matching alone reads as pasted-in: match key direction, bounce, optics/haze, edges/grounding).
- **Photoreal creature integration** — biological-accuracy vocabulary (wrinkled/cracked/asymmetric/matte, never smooth/glossy/inflated), telephoto-scale illusion, real contact shadow, reference-image-beats-description.
- **Timed camera moves synced to dialogue** — dual semantic + numeric anchoring, reveal pull-back with 100%-match landing, lip-sync preservation. **Prepended-intro budget** arithmetic (`total − intro = surviving window`).
- Two reference files — `references/dialogue-timing.md` (measure `T`, convert timecodes, phrase both anchors) and `references/first-frame.md` (generate the transformed start still, hand back as `start_image`).

### Wiring + template
- Routed from root `SKILL.md` (routing table + Sub-Skills table), `sub_skill_descriptions.py`, and `INDEX.md`. Roster **29 → 30**. Root version 3.17.0 → **3.18.0**.
- New `templates/seedance/footage-vfx-transform.md` — fill-in skeleton + four worked patterns (environment swap, head-on-fire, creature-with-reveal-pull-back, full handheld cinematic).

### Cross-links (patch bumps)
- `higgsfield-seedance` § Seedance 2.0 Prompt Modes / Transformation → distinguishes the in-clip morph from v2v footage transform; also added to Related Skills. (seedance 1.8.1→1.8.2)
- `higgsfield-audio` § Related skills → the timed-zoom-to-dialogue + source-dialogue-preservation cases. (audio 3.2.1→3.2.2)
- `higgsfield-camera` § Related skills → preserve a real handheld/driving move frame-for-frame + add a camera move you never filmed. (camera 3.3.0→3.3.1)
- `vocab.md` § Lighting Vocabulary / Scene-physics → the integration recipe for compositing a preserved subject or creature into a new plate.

## v3.17.0 — 2026-06-27

FACS (Facial Action Coding System) facial-expression control for Seedance 2.0 — directing a face by **muscle** (Action Unit codes like `AU12` lip-corner puller, `AU6` cheek raiser) instead of emotion labels. New **29th sub-skill** `higgsfield-facs`. Sourced from a practitioner brain-dump (AU-grid generation prompt + codes-in-prompt technique + worked examples); model-checked against the live `seedance_2_0` spec, which exposes **no FACS/expression field** — so the technique is flagged **[EMPIRICAL]** end to end (same provenance class as v3.16.0's Prompt-Craft Laws). One goal-driven release.

### New sub-skill — `higgsfield-facs` (1.0.0)
A consolidated facial-control layer on top of `higgsfield-seedance`. Sections:
- **What FACS is** + the provenance split (the AU vocabulary is standard science; Seedance's *interpretation* of codes is empirical, high-success-rate but **not a guarantee**) — and where it sits among the repo's three facial tools (named expression → behavior channel → Action Unit).
- **The plan-first workflow** — plan 3–4 expressions → generate a FACS sheet for *only those* → write the codes; explicitly counters the "generate the full 49-AU sheet then cherry-pick" anti-pattern.
- **Step 1 — generate the FACS reference sheet** — the parameterized image prompt (GPT Image 2 / Nano Banana Pro), the iterate-on-unreadable-captions note, and the **LLM-mislabels-AUs** caveat (the circulating sheet's `AU82` vs standard `AU38` nostril dilator; cross-check melindaozel.com/facs-cheat-sheet).
- **Step 2 — codes in the Seedance prompt** — codes-only vs codes+anatomical-description (test both), **3–4 expressions max** per generation, character photo optional (identity consistency only), beat-synced structure.
- **AU Code Reference** — the full grouped table (Forehead&Brow / Eye&Eyelid / Nose&Cheek / Lip&Mouth / Head Movement / Eye Direction / Special) with the non-standard-numbering caveat.
- **Emotion → AU recipes** — standard EMFACS prototypes (Duchenne AU6+AU12, sadness AU1+AU4+AU15, fear, anger, surprise, disgust, contempt) so the agent can answer "which code for anger?".
- **Dialogue & monologue facial acting** — the payoff: AU-per-beat schedule combined with the `[AUDIO: Xs]` lip-sync block; the performed-safety-over-visible-terror mixed-emotion pattern.
- Three worked examples (14-beat sweep, emotion arc, fear-masked-as-reassurance dialogue) + QUICK FACTS.

### Wiring + template
- Routed from root `SKILL.md` (routing table + Sub-Skills table), `sub_skill_descriptions.py`, and `INDEX.md`. Roster **28 → 29**. Root version 3.16.0 → **3.17.0**.
- New `templates/seedance/facs-expression-beats.md` — beat-synced AU schedule skeleton.

### Cross-links (patch bumps)
- `higgsfield-soul` § Micro-Expressions → FACS as the muscle-level layer beneath the 19 named expressions. (soul 3.6.0→3.6.1)
- `higgsfield-seedance` § Voice Rewrite §3 ("physics not emotion") → FACS as its muscle-level extreme. (seedance 1.8.0→1.8.1)
- `higgsfield-audio` § Lip-Sync Rules → FACS drives the expressive muscles around the phonemes. (audio 3.2.0→3.2.1)
- `vocab.md` § Emotion as Visible Behavior — Channels → AUs named as the anatomical sibling of the behavioral channels.

## v3.16.0 — 2026-06-27

Prompter updates from the Higgsfield "cinematic headphones ad" tutorial breakdown + a batch of Seedance 2.0 prompt/audio practitioner tips, model-checked against the live `seedance_2_0` spec. Four goals.

### Goal 1 — Audio as a conditioning input (model-verified)
The live spec confirms `seedance_2_0` accepts an `audio` reference media role and that `generate_audio` (native output) is *independent of audio reference medias* — i.e. uploaded audio conditions the generation, separate from generated sound. New `higgsfield-audio` § **Audio as a Conditioning Input** documents the two jobs of `@Audio1` (output track vs visual driver), **beat sync** (the 3-sentence audio→visual mapping + reference stacking + the temporal-compatibility constraint), the **`[AUDIO: Xs]` script block** (dialogue lip-sync + SFX from text alone, multilingual), and the **first-15s extraction trap** (pick a build→drop window, ≥256kbps). Cross-linked from `higgsfield-seedance` § Reference Roles. (audio 3.1.0→3.2.0, seedance 1.7.0→1.8.0)

### Goal 2 — Seedance prompt-craft laws (empirical)
New `higgsfield-seedance` § **Prompt-Craft Laws**: the left-to-right **attention model** (50–80-word sweet spot, front-load the load-bearing element, reconciled with the six-slot order and the >180-word filter ceiling), **"name the thing"** (replace "cinematic"/generic adjectives with a director/lighting/lens — the positive form of anti-slop), the **"fast" degradation keyword**, and **no negative prompts in the body** (scoped to Seedance, cross-linked to `shared/negative-constraints.md`). All flagged empirical, not model-documented. Anti-slop table in `higgsfield-prompt` extended with the named-referent substitute. (prompt 3.5.0→3.6.0)

### Goal 3 — Connected shotlist gap (P0)
New sub-skill **`higgsfield-shotlist-director`** — turns a brief/script into one editable HTML shotlist (global Style Prefix → `@`-glossary → named per-scene prompts in `Style → Characters → Scene → CUT 1..N`), with edit-once-propagates + per-scene-override semantics. Built to outclass the tutorial's downloadable skill by wiring in the preflight linter, reference-role lanes, Elements `@`-auto-attach, failure-mode awareness, and acceptance-rate logging. New `templates/seedance/global-style-prefix.md` (fill-in-the-blanks prefix + per-scene override example). Routed from root SKILL.md + `sub_skill_descriptions.py`.

### Goal 4 — Ad-asset prep + scene-craft patterns (P1–P3)
- New `templates/ad-asset-prep.md` — product sheet, grey-bg character sheet, **erase-duplicate-face**, **outfit 10-ideas→mix/recolor**, **multi-state variants**, prop sheets, and the **"design for win rate"** framing cross-linked to the acceptance-rate discipline.
- `higgsfield-soul` § Two-Tool Refinement Pipeline gains the **anti-"slop" layer-mask composite** worked example. (soul 3.5.0→3.6.0)
- `higgsfield-gpt-image-2/static-ads-workflow.md` gains **Mode C — Edit an existing still** (location editing, "keep everything else the same"). (gpt-image-2 1.1.0→1.2.0)
- `templates/10-dance-music-performance.md` gains **beat-by-beat choreography** + the **`@music_track`-drives-motion** pattern.
- `vocab.md` § Cut & Continuity gains **anchor-gesture cut ("cut on action")** + **multi-take micro-slice assembly**.
- `templates/seedance/top-down-map.md` gains **prop-scale-relative-to-a-landmark**.
- `CUT 1..N` labeling is demonstrated throughout the new shotlist-director skill.

## v3.15.2 — 2026-06-22

Privacy hygiene: **untracked `.planning/`** from the public repo. The nine `.planning/v3.7.x–v3.8.0/` build-execution notes were internal per-version planning artifacts that don't belong in a public skill library and were the source of the home-path PII scrubbed in v3.15.1. They are now git-ignored — kept on the maintainer's disk, removed from tracking.

- **Dangling provenance links cleaned up:** six shipped files (the two `higgsfield-gpt-image-2` docs, the two `higgsfield-marketing-studio` docs, `assets/fonts/README.md`, and a `docs/archive/` note) cited `.planning/` paths as verification trails — 18 path references. Those were rewritten to keep the provenance prose ("the v3.7.16 Phase 0 verification notes (internal build notes)") without the now-dead links, so `validate.py`'s relative-path check passes. CI caught these (a local run masked them — the untracked files still exist on disk locally but not in a fresh checkout).
- Their prior contents remain in git history; a history rewrite was intentionally not done, as the only exposure was a macOS username + folder names, never credentials. `validate.py --strict` clean, 110 tests pass, evals 40/40.

## v3.15.1 — 2026-06-22

Post-series hygiene: activation docs, a privacy scrub, and a clean Problems panel.

- **README § Maintenance** documents the two one-time activation steps the series left dormant: adding the `HIGGSFIELD_CREDENTIALS` secret to turn on the scheduled spec-drift check, and letting `log-route` routing data accumulate before pruning the long tail. Notes that credentials live only in the GitHub secret, never committed.
- **Privacy scrub:** removed absolute home-path PII (`/Users/<user>/...`, 5 occurrences) from `.planning/v3.7.16/PHASE-0-VERIFICATION.md` → `~`. Security pass otherwise clean: no tokens/credentials in the tree or git history, `specs/cli_baseline.json` is public model schema only, `workspace/` content is gitignored.
- **markdownlint hygiene:** extended `.markdownlint.json` to opt out of the remaining cosmetic rules firing on long historical docs (MD012/MD031/MD038/MD040/MD041), consistent with the existing MD013/MD022/MD032/MD060 opt-outs. No code/CI behavior change; `validate.py --strict` and the eval suite are unaffected.

## v3.15.0 — 2026-06-22

Finale of the framework-improvement series — the two remaining closers: Wave C's **scheduling wrapper** and **item 6's routing-telemetry surface**.

### Wave C scheduling — `.github/workflows/spec-drift.yml`
A weekly scheduled run of the now-trustworthy `refresh_specs.py` tripwire (Mondays, ~3 weeks ahead of the 30-day staleness WARN). Installs the CLI, restores credentials from a `HIGGSFIELD_CREDENTIALS` secret, and branches on the three exit states:
- **0 fresh** → success, nothing.
- **3 drift** → opens (or comments on) a GitHub issue with the report + the Tier-2 next steps.
- **1 pull-failed** → **fails the job loudly.** This is the auth-refresh story: the CLI access_token expires (its refresh_token extends but eventually lapses → "Session expired"), and rather than fragile auto-rotation, expiry surfaces as a red workflow + GitHub notification — re-run `higgsfield auth login` and update the secret. Setup + the auth story are documented in the workflow header. Detect-only; it never writes specs or merges.

### Item 6 — routing telemetry (`log-route` / `routing`)
The surface that makes "find the load-bearing skills, prune the long tail" answerable from **data instead of a guess**. HARD RULE #1 already makes the agent name its routes on every response's first line; this persists that declaration. New `db/routing-log.json` (append-only) + `log-route --skills a,b,c` (validated against the canonical 27-skill roster, so a typo can't fragment the counts) + `routing` (ranks sub-skills by opens, lists the never-opened tail). `validate.py` gains a `[ ROUTING ]` schema check (reusing `validate_route_entry`). Logged in `higgsfield-recall`.
- **Honest framing baked in:** this is *instrumentation, not a verdict* — the pruning DECISION waits until enough requests accumulate to trust the distribution; a small sample is not evidence a skill is dead. (And item 6 was never unblocked by item 3's `prompt_method` — it needed this separate routing surface, which now exists.)
- 8 new pytest cases (roster validation, aggregation, never-opened tail, seed-file validity). The 12 + 4 Wave C `refresh_specs` cases unchanged.
